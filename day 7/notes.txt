			Web API is all about Data 

			Data can be anywhere

			Clients / Projects will decide the data source


		When the data source changes, we need to rewrite a lot of code, and it will take time
		but also complexicity


	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Thus any type of pattern is recommended - and for WebAPI / Data 
				Repository Pattern


			Any DI is based on Interface, 

				We create an interface and a class with will deal with the data source
