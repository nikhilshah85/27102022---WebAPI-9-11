As a developer, we create lots of objects in an app
We never write destructor, or even call dispose method


Thus in a web app, where server recieves more than 1000 request in a day

server keeps getting flodded with objects and reference

However, GC takes care of it, but we dont know when will GC comes

----------------------------------------------------------------

Thus now on, We as a developer should not create any object, framework/Runtime will create the object

	1. Object will be created by Runtime, and will be Injected at the place of need
	2. Object will be destoyed by runtime, bases on your configuration
		This is based on shareing the object
			object can be created and destroyed based on following
			1. For every new request 
				(PerCall - Transcient)

			2. For every user (session) - 1 new obj for every user
				 (PerSession)
			3. Global Object - same object used by every user (eg. connection string) -
				 (SingleTon)
